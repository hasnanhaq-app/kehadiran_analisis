# Simple FastAPI app

This is a minimal FastAPI example using a venv.

Quick start (macOS / zsh):

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
cd /Users/macbookm1/Code/python/fastAPI-base
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

4. Run tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q
```

Notes:
- The app is simple and stores items in memory. For production, use a database.
- `.venv/` is ignored in `.gitignore`.

Database (MySQL) configuration
--------------------------------

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to your MySQL database. Example:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname"
```

If `DATABASE_URL` is not set the app defaults to a local SQLite file `./test.db` which is convenient for development and testing.

Note: This project uses SQLAlchemy ORM. For production schema migrations, integrate Alembic.

Alembic (database migrations)
------------------------------

This project includes an Alembic configuration that reads the `DATABASE_URL` from
the environment. Use Alembic to generate, inspect, and apply schema migrations.

Basic workflow (development)

1. Load environment variables and activate the venv

```bash
cd /Users/macbookm1/Code/python/fastAPI-base
set -a; source .env; set +a
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

2. Generate an autogenerate migration (creates a new file under `alembic/versions`)

```bash
alembic -c alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "describe changes"
```

3. Review the generated migration file and adjust if needed. Then apply it to the
	target database:

```bash
alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
```

If the database already contains the tables (for example you created them manually or via `init_db()`),
mark the current revision without applying SQL with:

```bash
# record current models as applied
alembic -c alembic.ini stamp head
```

Useful Alembic commands

- `alembic -c alembic.ini current` — show current revision of the DB
- `alembic -c alembic.ini history` — show migration history
- `alembic -c alembic.ini downgrade -1` — roll back one migration
- `alembic -c alembic.ini show <rev>` — show revision script

Notes and safety

- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying them, especially in production.
- Do not run migrations against a production database without backups and a rollback plan.
- For CI, create a fresh test database and run `alembic upgrade head` against it to ensure migrations apply.
- Alembic uses `alembic/env.py` which imports `app.models` to gather `MetaData` for autogenerate — keep your models importable (use `PYTHONPATH=.` when running commands from project root).

If you want, I can add convenience Makefile targets (e.g. `make db-upgrade`, `make db-rev`) or CI steps that run Alembic automatically.

Controlling automatic DB creation
--------------------------------

For local convenience the app can attempt to create the database on startup (this is useful when you don't want to run `CREATE DATABASE` manually). This is disabled by default in production. To enable it set the `CREATE_DB_ON_STARTUP` environment variable to `true`, `1` or `yes`.

You can set this in your `.env` (example):

```env
CREATE_DB_ON_STARTUP=true
```

If enabled, on startup the app will run `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ...` (MySQL only) before creating tables. The connecting user must have privileges to create databases.

Running the app with environment variables loaded
------------------------------------------------

Quick way to load `.env` and start the server (zsh):

```bash
cd /Users/macbookm1/Code/python/fastAPI-base
source .venv/bin/activate
# load .env and export values
set -a; source .env; set +a
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Or use the provided helper script which activates the venv (if present), loads `.env`, and runs `uvicorn`:

```bash
./scripts/run_uvicorn.sh
```

If you want to run the server in background for development, you can use `nohup` or a process manager. Example (background, simple):

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
nohup uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &>/dev/null &
```

For production on macOS consider using launchd or a process manager (supervisord, systemd on Linux, or container orchestration). Brew service wrappers can also be used if you package the app as a service.
